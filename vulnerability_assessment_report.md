# Vulnerability Assessment Report  
---

## System Description
The database server operates on a modern Linux distribution and is equipped with a high-performance CPU and 128GB of RAM. It hosts a MySQL database management system and communicates with internal network resources over IPv4. The system maintains a stable network connection and currently secures traffic using SSL/TLS encryption.

---

## Scope
This assessment evaluates the system’s existing access control mechanisms. The review covers a three-month period from **June 2025 through August 2025**. All risk analysis and terminology follow the guidance of **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**.

---

## Purpose
The server functions as a centralized platform for storing customer, campaign, and analytics data that supports marketing operations. Because this information directly influences business decisions and performance tracking, maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system is essential.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Matrix

| Threat Source | Threat Event                               | Likelihood (1–3) | Severity (1–3) | Risk Score |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Hacker        | Exfiltration of sensitive information       | 3                 | 3              | 9          |
| Employee      | Disruption of mission-critical operations   | 2                 | 3              | 6          |
| Customer      | Modification or deletion of critical data   | 1                 | 3              | 3          |

## Assessment Approach
Risk ratings were determined by analyzing the organization’s current data storage practices and access management procedures. Threat sources and events were identified based on existing open access configurations, and likelihood values were assigned according to the probability of an incident occurring under current conditions. Severity ratings reflect the potential operational impact on daily business functions.

---

## Remediation Strategy
To reduce identified risks, the following controls are recommended:

- Enforce strong authentication and authorization policies, including role-based access controls and multi-factor authentication.  
- Replace SSL with modern **TLS-only** encryption for all data-in-transit.  
- Implement an IP allow-list restricting database access to approved corporate locations.  
- Enable comprehensive auditing to track access attempts and changes to sensitive data.
