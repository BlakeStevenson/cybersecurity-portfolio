# Professional Statement

I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong interest in protecting information systems and preventing security threats. Through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, I have developed foundational knowledge of security principles, including risk management, access control, and the use of tools like Linux, SQL, and Python. My background as a certified pharmacy technician has given me experience working in highly regulated environments where attention to detail, compliance, and protecting sensitive information are essential.

I am particularly motivated by the challenge of safeguarding data and supporting organizations in building resilient systems that protect both business operations and end users. My goal is to begin my career as a security analyst, where I can apply my growing technical skills, problem-solving ability, and commitment to continuous learning. Over time, I hope to expand into specialized areas of cybersecurity such as threat detection and incident response.

I bring persistence, adaptability, and a dedication to ethical practices, which I believe are critical qualities in cybersecurity. I am excited to contribute to an organizationâ€™s mission while continuing to build my expertise and make a positive impact in the field.
