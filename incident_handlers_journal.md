### The 5 W’s  
- **Who:** A coordinated team of malicious cyber actors  
- **What:** A ransomware compromise targeting organizational systems  
- **Where:** Within a medical services organization  
- **When:** Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m.  
- **Why:** Attackers infiltrated the network through a successful phishing email. Once inside, they deployed ransomware that locked essential data by encrypting it. The attackers appear financially motivated, as they left a ransom demand requesting a significant payment in exchange for the decryption key.

### Additional Notes  
1. What long-term security measures can the organization implement to reduce the likelihood of a similar attack?  
2. Should the organization consider paying the ransom to potentially regain access to their data?
